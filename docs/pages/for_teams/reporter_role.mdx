### Project Information

Reporters can access general project information related to deployments, including:

## Best Practices for Reporters

1. Regularly check ticket status to stay informed about upcoming and recent deployments.
2. Use the deployment task history to identify patterns or issues in the deployment process.
3. Communicate any observations or concerns to project owners or managers.
4. Familiarize yourself with the project structure and deployment environments to better understand the context of the information you're viewing.

## Limitations

As a Reporter, you cannot:

- Create or modify tickets
- Initiate or approve deployments
- Change any project settings

If you need additional permissions, please contact your project owner or system administrator.

By effectively utilizing your access as a Reporter, you can play a crucial role in monitoring project progress and providing valuable insights to your team.
