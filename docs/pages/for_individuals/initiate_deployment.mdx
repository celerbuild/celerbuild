## Managing Branch and Tag Limits

The number of branches or tags available for selection is determined by your project settings.

> **Tip**: Limiting the number of branches or tags can improve loading times. Too many options may slow down the interface.

To adjust these settings:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Find the section for branch/tag limits
3. Set your preferred limits

## Viewing and Managing Deployment Tickets

After submitting a deployment request, you can track its progress in the Tickets section.

- **Standard Version**: Deployment requests are automatically approved without review.
- **Pro Version**: You can enable a review process for deployments.
