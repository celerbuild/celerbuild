# Project Configuration in CelerBuild

CelerBuild project configuration consists of two main sections: Basic Settings and Deployment Settings. This guide will walk you through each section to help you set up your project effectively.

## 1. Basic Project Settings

Configure the fundamental aspects of your project:

![Basic Project Settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a50f187d-5d7d-493f-9af9-e117e5fa7ee8)

1. **Project Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name.

2. **Environment**: Select the deployment environment (e.g., dev, staging, production).

3. **Space Selection**:
    - Standard version: Use 'default'
    - Pro version: Add and select multiple spaces

4. **Git Repository**: Provide the URL of your project's Git repository.

5. **Target Deployment Path**: Specify the server path for project deployment.

6. **Target Deployment Repository Path**: Define the storage location for project packages pre-deployment.

7. **Target Repository Version Retention**: Set the number of project package versions to retain.

8. **Branch/Tag Selection**:
    - Branch: Specify which branches to use
    - Tag: Set the number of latest tags to use

> **Note**: Limiting the number of branches or tags improves synchronization efficiency during deployment requests.

9. **Server Cluster**: Choose the deployment server cluster.



## 2. Project Deployment Settings

After basic configuration, set up deployment specifics:

![Deployment Settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aca2ea1c-63c2-450c-8632-92811ea170a8)

1. **Deployment User**: Specify the user account for deployment execution. Ensure this user:
    - Exists on all cluster servers
    - Has necessary execution permissions

2. **Build Commands**: Enter project build commands. Example:

```shell
make build && cd build && tar -zcvf ${LOCAL_PACKAGE_FILE} *
   ```
This command performs the following actions:
1. `make build`: Executes the build process defined in your Makefile.
2. `cd build`: Changes the current directory to the 'build' folder.
3. `tar -zcvf ${LOCAL_PACKAGE_FILE} *`: Creates a compressed tar archive of all files in the current directory.

> **Important Notes**:
> - Adjust `make build && cd build` to match your project's specific build process.
> - The `tar -zcvf ${LOCAL_PACKAGE_FILE} *` command is a required fixed syntax. It must be included at the end of your build command to package local files for deployment.
> - `${LOCAL_PACKAGE_FILE}` is a built-in variable that CelerBuild uses to identify the package for deployment.
> - This packaging step is crucial for preparing your files for the subsequent deployment and extraction process.

When defining your build commands, ensure that you include your project-specific build steps followed by the required tar command. This ensures that your project is correctly built and packaged for deployment.

3. **Pre-deployment Commands** (Optional):
Commands to run before the main deployment process. Refer to the following example using built-in variables.

4. **Post-deployment Commands** (Optional):
Commands to run after the main deployment process. An example is executing the start script:
```shell copy
./start.sh
   ```



## Built-in Environment Variables

CelerBuild provides several built-in environment variables for use in your deployment scripts:

- `${LOCAL_PACKAGE_FILE}`: Path to the file generated during packaging
- `${TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_PATH}`: The specified Target Deployment Path
- `${TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_PROJECT_NAME}`: Generated project name for target server deployment (related to project ID)

Example using built-in variables:

```shell copy
: PROJECT_DIR="${TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_PATH}/${TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_PROJECT_NAME}"; [ -d "$PROJECT_DIR" ] && cd "$PROJECT_DIR" && ./stop.sh || echo "Directory $PROJECT_DIR does not exist"
```

This command demonstrates the use of built-in variables and performs the following actions:

1. Sets the `PROJECT_DIR` variable using `TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_PATH` and `TARGET_DEPLOYMENT_PROJECT_NAME`.
2. Checks if the directory exists using `[ -d "$PROJECT_DIR" ]`.
3. If the directory exists:
    - Changes to the directory (`cd "$PROJECT_DIR"`)
    - Executes the `stop.sh` script
4. If the directory doesn't exist:
    - Prints an error message

This example showcases how to use CelerBuild's built-in variables to create dynamic paths and perform conditional actions during deployment.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive, unique project names within your organization.
- Regularly update your Git repository URL if it changes.
- Optimize build commands for efficiency and reliability.
- Utilize pre-deployment commands for tasks like database backups or service notifications.
- Implement post-deployment commands for cache clearing or service restarts.
- Limit branch/tag numbers in project configuration:
    - Improves synchronization speed during deployment requests
    - Specify only actively used branches or recent tags
    - Regularly clean up old or unused branches and tags
- Balance deployment options with system performance.
- Leverage built-in environment variables in your deployment scripts for consistency and ease of maintenance.
- Test your deployment configuration in a staging environment before applying to production.
- Document any custom settings or scripts used in your deployment process.

By carefully configuring these settings, you'll ensure a smooth and efficient deployment process with CelerBuild.
