# Base Module Configuration

Before setting up your project in CelerBuild, it's essential to configure the Base module components: Server Clusters, Servers, and Environments (Envs). This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.

## 1. Configuring Server Clusters

Server clusters help organize your servers into logical groups, making management easier.

To add a new server cluster:

1. Navigate to the Base Module section
2. Click on "Server Clusters"
3. Select "Add New Cluster"
4. Enter a name for your cluster
5. Click "Submit" to create the cluster

## 2. Configuring Servers

Once you've set up your server clusters, you can add individual servers to them.

To add a new server:

1. Go to the "Servers" section in the Base Module
2. Click "Add New Server"
3. Fill in the following details:
    - Server Name
    - Server IP
    - SSH Port
4. Select the cluster you want to add this server to
5. Click "Add Server" to save

## 3. Configuring Environments (Envs)

Environments in CelerBuild allow you to manage different deployment stages (e.g., development, staging, production).

> **Note**: CelerBuild comes with pre-configured environments by default. You can use these as-is or modify them to suit your needs.

To modify environments:

1. Navigate to the "Envs" section in the Base Module
2. Click on an existing environment to edit, or "Add New Environment"
3. Customize the settings as needed
4. Save your changes

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for your server clusters and servers
- Keep your environment configurations consistent across projects
- Regularly review and update your server configurations
- Document your custom environment settings for future reference

By properly configuring these base components, you'll set a strong foundation for efficient project management and deployment in CelerBuild.
