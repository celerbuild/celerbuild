### 4. Verify the Deployment

After the deployment completes:

1. Check the final status (Success or Failure)
2. Review the complete logs for any issues
3. Test the deployed application to ensure it's functioning correctly

## Best Practices

- Always review the deployment configuration before starting
- Keep an eye on the logs during deployment for early problem detection
- Perform a quick smoke test immediately after deployment
- Have a rollback plan ready in case of unexpected issues

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors during the deployment:

1. Check the error messages in the logs
2. Open an [issue](https://github.com/celerbuild/celerbuild/issues) for error reports
3. If the issue persists, contact us

Remember, a successful deployment is crucial for your application's stability and performance. Take your time to ensure everything is correct before and after the deployment process.
