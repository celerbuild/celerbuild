# FAQ

## How do I choose the right plan?
If you're an individual developer or working on small projects, the Standard plan should meet your needs. For teams or businesses requiring advanced collaboration features, the Pro plan is recommended.

## Do you offer a free trial?

Yes, we offer a 7-day trial period when you subscribe to any plan. During these 7 days, you can explore all features of CelerBuild without being charged. If you're not satisfied, you can cancel anytime within the trial period at no cost. If you decide to continue, billing will start automatically after the 7-day trial ends.

## Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?

Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Whether you're upgrading or downgrading, once you change your subscription plan and complete the payment, you'll immediately have access to all the features of your new plan. The new billing cycle will start from the moment the change takes effect.

##  What payment methods do you accept?

We accept credit cards and debit cards via Stripe.
