# Download and Install CelerBuild

These instructions will guide you through downloading and installing the latest version of CelerBuild.

## 1. Download

First, determine the latest version of CelerBuild by visiting the [CelerBuild official website](https://celerbuild.com/download).

Replace `{VERSION}` in the following commands with the actual latest version number.

### macOS (darwin-amd64)

```shell copy
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celerbuild/download/refs/heads/main/celerbuild-{VERSION}-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
```

### Linux (x86_64)

```shell copy
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celerbuild/download/refs/heads/main/celerbuild-{VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Alternatively, you can download directly from the official website by clicking the download button for your operating system.

## 2. Extract the File

Run the following command to extract the file:

```shell copy
tar zxvf celerbuild-{VERSION}-{OS}-{ARCH}.tar.gz
```

Replace `{OS}` with either `darwin` or `linux`, and `{ARCH}` with your system architecture (e.g., `amd64`).

## 3. Set Permissions

Ensure the extracted file has execute permissions:

```shell copy
chmod +x celerbuild-{VERSION}-{OS}-{ARCH}
```

## 4. Run CelerBuild

```shell copy
./celerbuild-{VERSION}-{OS}-{ARCH}
```

Note: On first run, CelerBuild will create a default configuration file.
