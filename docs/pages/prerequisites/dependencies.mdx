Supports deployment on Linux and Mac OS environments. Windows deployment is not supported.

# 1. Install MariaDB

## Install MariaDB on Linux
On Linux, different distributions have different installation methods:

### Ubuntu/Debian

```shell copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
When running the mysql_secure_installation command, follow the prompts for security settings.

### CentOS/RHEL

```shell copy
sudo yum update
sudo yum install mariadb-server
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
When running the mysql_secure_installation command, follow the prompts for security settings.

## Install MariaDB on Mac OS

On Mac OS, you can use Homebrew to install MariaDB:

```shell copy
brew update
brew install mariadb
brew services start mariadb
```
After installation, you can use the mysql_secure_installation command for security settings.

# 2. Deploy Public Key

To enable secure, password-less SSH access between the CelerBuild deployment machine and your remote servers, you need to set up public key authentication. Follow these steps:

1. Generate an SSH key pair (if you haven't already):
```bash copy
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
Press Enter to accept the default file location and optionally set a passphrase.

2. Display and copy the public key:

```bash copy
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Manually select and copy the entire output.

Alternative methods for copying (if needed):
- On macOS:
```bash copy
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
- On Linux with graphical interface:
```bash copy
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -selection clipboard
  ```
Note: If you encounter the error "Command 'xclip' not found", you can install it using:
```bash copy
sudo apt install xclip  # For Ubuntu/Debian
# or
sudo yum install xclip  # For CentOS/RHEL
  ```

3. Add the public key to the remote server:

a. If you have `ssh-copy-id` available:
```bash copy
ssh-copy-id user@remote_server
   ```
b. If you prefer manual setup or don't have `ssh-copy-id`:
   - SSH into your remote server:
```bash copy
ssh user@remote_server
     ```
   - Create the .ssh directory if it doesn't exist and set permissions:
```bash copy
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
     ```
   - Open or create the authorized_keys file with vim:
```bash copy
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```
   - Press 'i' to enter insert mode, then paste the copied public key.
   - Press 'Esc', then type ':wq' and press Enter to save and exit vim.
   - Set proper permissions for the authorized_keys file:
```bash copy
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```

4. Test the connection:
```bash copy
ssh user@remote_server
```
You should be able to log in without entering a password.

Troubleshooting:
- If you encounter "Permission denied (publickey)" errors, ensure the permissions on both the local and remote .ssh directories and files are correct.
- For AWS EC2 instances, you may need to use the .pem file for initial access:
```bash copy
ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ec2-user@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  ```

Note: While RSA keys are sufficient for most uses, Ed25519 keys offer enhanced security. Using a strong passphrase is recommended but optional.
