# Remote Sync Setup

Remote Sync is a feature that automatically maintains your CelerBuild activation status. When enabled, it eliminates the need for manual reactivation after your license expires. This guide will walk you through the process of enabling and configuring Remote Sync.

## Prerequisites

- Database configured (see [Database Configuration](./database_configuration.mdx))

## Accessing the CelerBuild Dashboard

1. Open a web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8666/login
   ```
Note: If you've configured a different port, use that instead of 8666.

2. Log in with the default credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `adminadmin`

> **Important:** For security reasons, change the default password immediately after your first login.

4. Save your changes.
