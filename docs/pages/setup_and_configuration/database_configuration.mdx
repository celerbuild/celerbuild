# Database Configuration

CelerBuild uses MariaDB as its database. This guide will help you configure the database connection.

## Configuration File Location

The database configuration file is located at:

```
~/.celerbuild/config/mariadb.yaml
```

## Default Configuration

By default, the configuration file contains the following settings:

```yaml
db_user: ""
db_password: ""
db_host: 127.0.0.1
db_port: "3306"
db_name: celerbuild
```

## Configuring Your Database Connection

You need to modify these settings to match your MariaDB setup. Here's what each field means:

- `db_user`: Your MariaDB username
- `db_password`: Your MariaDB password
- `db_host`: The host where your MariaDB server is running (use `127.0.0.1` for localhost)
- `db_port`: The port your MariaDB server is listening on (default is 3306)
- `db_name`: The name of the database for CelerBuild (default is `celerbuild`)


## Important Notes

- Ensure that the MariaDB user has the necessary permissions to create, read, update, and delete in the specified database.
- Use a strong, unique password for your database user.
- If you're using a remote database, replace `127.0.0.1` with the appropriate hostname or IP address.

## Verifying the Connection

After configuring the database, you can verify the connection by starting CelerBuild. If there are any connection issues, CelerBuild will display an error message with details.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues connecting to the database:

1. Double-check your configuration settings.
2. Ensure MariaDB is running and accessible.
3. Verify that the specified user has the correct permissions.
4. Check your firewall settings if using a remote database.

## Next Steps

After configuring your database connection, the next important step is to set up Remote Sync. This feature ensures that your CelerBuild instance stays up-to-date and properly activated.

To continue with your setup process, please proceed to the [Remote Sync Setup](../setup_and_configuration/remote_sync_setup.mdx) guide.
